### I'm Matt Glaman ðŸ‘‹

I maintain [drupal-check](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check) and [phpstan-drupal](https://github.com/mglaman/phpstan-drupal), used by the [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) community and projects for static code anaylsis and deprecated code detection.

You can catch me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nmdmatt) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFntxnFeNN9DXNNrPi4s4Hg), or my [Blog](https://glamanate.com/).
